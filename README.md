Simple game created with JavaScript.
For more info: [see this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)
Game is created on the front-end, with simple logic:

 1. player clicks on created gameboard with mouse;
 2. on click adds: first X then O to the squares;
 3. game logic compares gamboard (filled by user clicks) with gaved array.
 4. if game finds a match from array - game is done, winner is shown and game is over
 5. if no matches found - game is still going.
 6. if no matches found and gameboard is full with player inputs (X's and O's) - game is draw and you need to restart game

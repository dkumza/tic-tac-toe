Game is created on the front-end, with simple logic:

 2. on click adds: X then computer foes for O to the squares;
 3. game logic compares gamboard (filled by user and random computer clicks) with gaved array.
 4. if game finds a match from array - game is done, winner is shown and game is over
 5. if no matches found - game is still going.
 6. if no matches found and gameboard is full with player inputs (X's and O's) - game is draw.

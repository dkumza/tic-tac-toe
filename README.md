 3. game logic compares gamboard (filled by user clicks) with gaved array.
 4. if game finds a match from array - game is done, winner is shown and game is over
 5. if no matches found - game is still going.
 6. if no matches found and gameboard is full with player inputs (X's and O's) - game is draw and you need to restart game
